11:T439,Title: Esports Tournament
Prompt:
Create a single-page app, in a single HTML file, for a neon, high-contrast esports tournament landing page.
Hero: animated 3D/Canvas backdrop with subtle scanlines; bold headline, date, and CTA buttons (“Register Team”, “Get Tickets”, “Watch Live”).
Interactive bracket: 8/16-team bracket with hover states, team logos, and match times; auto-advance demo mode.
Schedule section: timezone-aware match list with filters (stage, day) and an “Add to calendar” button (ICS export).
Team cards: roster, roles, country flags, recent form; responsive grid with quick compare.
Stream preview: embedded placeholder player with “Now/Next” ticker and sponsor carousel.
Venue & travel: map image, directions links, hotels list; accessibility and safety notes.
Social proof: testimonials, follower counts, and recent highlights carousel.  
Footer: FAQs, rules PDF link, code of conduct, contact form; sticky “Buy Tickets” CTA on mobile.  
Performance: lazy-loaded images, prefers-reduced-motion support; clean, modern, fully responsive.
12:T422,Create a single-page app in a single HTML file that provides the following features using modern, user-friendly web frontend components suitable for business users:
- Display a large table view listing all database rows. The data includes event participant feedback submissions with columns for date, event name, participant name, rating, and feedback.
- Feedback should be a bit long, but the table should nicely display it as well
- Add a search bar at the top that allows users to filter entries by keyword.
- Place an "AI summary" section at the top with a close button.
- Populate the table with a realistic, randomly generated dataset containing 30 entries.
- Enable users to sort the table by clicking on a column header; the table should reorder the rows in ascending or descending order, with icons indicating the current sort direction.
- Pay attention to details: ensure the layout and UI remain intact, colors are used effectively (a monotone business palette is safe, but feel free to be creative!), and no part of the interface appears broken.
13:T42f,Title: Kinetic Typography Studio
Prompt:
Create a single-page app, in a single HTML file, that lets users design and export animated text sequences.
Timeline editor with keyframes for position, scale, rotation, opacity, letter/word offsets, and tracking; easing curves with presets and custom Bézier.
Animation presets: typewriter, bounce, liquid, glitch, fade-up, cascade by word/letter/line; per-glyph stagger controls.
Audio-reactive mode: load a local audio file, auto-detect beats, and snap keyframes to bars/beats; live preview with scrub.
Style controls: font picker (system + a few bundled web fonts), weight, italics, fill/outline, gradients, shadows, motion blur toggle, background color or image.
Layout tools: safe-area guides, 1:1/9:16/16:9 aspect presets, margins, grid.
Export: MP4/WebM/GIF or PNG sequence; include frame rate and resolution options; render without UI chrome.
Accessibility: keyboard shortcuts, focus order, ARIA labels on controls; “prefers-reduced-motion” reduces heavy effects.
Responsive, touch + mouse support; no external APIs.
14:T4c7,Create a single-page app, in a single HTML file:
a Tic Tac Toe game that is Roman Empire themed, fully responsive, and modern.

Requirements:
- Full-viewport, fluid board (vmin-based) and mobile/desktop responsive layout.
- Roman theme: marble background, gold accents, SPQR crest, subtle Colosseum vibe.
- Clean top bar with only three buttons: “New Round”, “Customize”, “Reset Scores”.
- Put all options in a “Customize” dialog:
  • Theme: Marble Day / Night Legion
  • Glyphs: Standard X/O or Gladius/Laurel
  • Mode: 2-player or vs AI
  • First move: X or O
  • AI discipline: Perfect / Pragmatic / Reckless
- Game logic:
  • Perfect-play AI via minimax with difficulty handicaps
  • Scoreboard for X, O, and Draws
  • Gold win highlight + non-overlapping victory banner under header
  • Canvas-based confetti on win (no DOM node spraying), respects prefers-reduced-motion
- Accessibility: ARIA roles for grid/cells, live status updates, keyboard + touch support.
- Visuals: smooth hover/press states, soft shadows, rounded corners, scalable typography.
- Constraints: no element overlap or flashing; no external JS frameworks; one HTML file with inline CSS/JS (Google Fonts allowed).
